# Implementation Request: official_k562_p1_official_swa_or_checkpoint_ensemble_63c03f89

## Research Task

K562 CRISPR perturbation DEG three-class classification on the official task contract. The node must predict logits for all 6,640 target genes and 3 DEG classes.

## Parent

`official_k562_p2_official_focal_loss_training_11ab1cb3`
- parent val Macro-F1: `0.3705071210861206`
- parent strategy: `official_focal_loss_training`

## Blueprint

- id: `official_swa_or_checkpoint_ensemble`
- status: `planned`
- category: `training_strategy`
- paper family: `checkpoint_ensemble_or_SWA`
- role: Evaluate SWA or top-k checkpoint ensemble where checkpoint policy is explicit.
- requires: official_essential_deg_with_split_h5ad
- missing required artifacts now: none

## Contract Files

- `artifact_contract.json`: required/present/missing artifacts and strict-mode policy
- `smoke_contract.json`: compile, forward/backward, and training-smoke commands
- `parent_summary.json`: parent score/config/artifact context
- `pipeline.json`: executable pipeline grammar and artifact claims

## Implementation Notes

Codex must not tune ensemble on test labels; record validation checkpoint selection.

## Pipeline Grammar

```json
{
  "blueprint": "official_swa_or_checkpoint_ensemble",
  "representation": "unspecified",
  "perturbation_side": "unspecified",
  "target_side": "unspecified",
  "fusion": "unspecified",
  "prior": "unspecified",
  "head": "unspecified",
  "training_strategy": "unspecified",
  "fine_tuning": "unspecified",
  "required_artifacts": [],
  "paper_alignment": "blueprint not yet mapped into the grammar"
}
```

## Required File

Create this file:

```text
experiments/official_k562_scientific_policy_run_50/programs/official_k562_p1_official_swa_or_checkpoint_ensemble_63c03f89/model.py
```

It must define `class GeneratedModel(nn.Module)` with `__init__(self, spec)` and `forward(self, x)`. The forward pass must return `[batch, n_targets, n_classes]` logits, which is `[batch, 6640, 3]` for official K562.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Records top-k or SWA policy
- No test leakage
- Reports val/test separately

## Guardrails

Allowed files: node-local `model.py`, node-local config/pipeline metadata, and small helper modules under `src/vc_demo/official_k562/` when genuinely reusable.
Forbidden changes: official split files, labels, target-gene order, metric semantics, and artifact provenance.
Strict artifact rule: if a required artifact is missing, acquire the real artifact or block; do not train a fallback.
Smoke gate: run the commands in `smoke_contract.json` before training.
Keep the model compact enough for the current RunPod GPU.
